Git Merge Conflict


Letâ€™s create a conflict in the same file, same line on 2 different branches (main and Sk_test2). 
	On the main branch made the changes, committed and pushed to the main.
	On the new branch, changes are added and committed.

On the new branch before committing changes we have to make sure that the branch is up to date with the master. For that do git merge main
In the vs code, the changes are highlighted in vscode and will be asked to make the changes (accept both changes, accept incoming etc..)
