Git Branching & Merging

To check the current branch do git branch

To create and switch to new branch do git checkout -b Sk_test

If we edit the file in new branch and did git add and git commit from visual studio and then switch the branch. We can see that the new
changes are not in main branch but will be available in new branch (Sk_test).

If we want to merge both the branches :

	First check what is the difference between both the branches. If we are in main branch and want to check with new branch (Sk_test) 
	do git diff Sk_test

	Since the new branch have additional content will be shown as - (-ve showing that the current branch have contents missing). Assume if the content 	is less it will be shown as +(+ve showing that the current branch have more contents)

	Now do git push the changes to new branch (Sk_test) by doing git push -u origin Sk_test

	After the push in the GitHub (web) you see a message saying there is a push from another branch (currently you are in main branch) and
	would like to “Compare & pull request”

	Select the option. It will show the option of where to where the branch is getting merged. (Here it is Sk_test to master). Leave a comment.
 
	
	Once the reviewer approves it do Merge pull request

	But in the visual studio you won’t see the changes merged as the changes are done in GitHub web. Do a git pull to reflect the changes
	in main branch.


Delete a branch:

To delete a branch do git branch -d Sk_test. Do git branch to verify and you see only main branch present.
